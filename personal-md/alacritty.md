# Alacritty
Alacritty is a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.

## Configuration
- **background_opacity: float** can be used to set the background opacity. This
should be used in conjunction with a compositing manager.

## Warnings
Since Alacritty can be accelerated by the GPU, any updates to drivers may
require a restart for Alacritty to return to a usable state.
