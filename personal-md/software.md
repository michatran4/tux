# Personal Software
This is a list of software I use on Linux.

## Desktop
I use [dwm](../rocks/dwm.html). I have previously used and recommend KDE and bspwm.

## Terminal emulators
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is my main terminal
emulator of choice.
    - Since Alacritty can be accelerated by the GPU, any updates to drivers may
require a restart for Alacritty to return to a usable state.
- [st](../rocks/st.html) is a backup terminal.

I like the backgrounds on my terminals slightly transparent.

## Brave
The Brave browser is a Chromium based web browser that stands out with its own
cryptocurrency, BAT. It has access to the same extensions that Chrome does, so
it's practically the same, just without Google.

## Text editing
- I use [neovim](../main/vim.html) as my main text editor.
- [VS Codium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) is my IDE of choice for
simple tasks.
- I enjoy using Jetbrains' products for more serious projects.

## zsh
Z shell is a powerful alternative to bash.

## Miscellaneous software
- I use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) for audio editing.
- I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com) for video recording. I haven't fully
switched to ffmpeg.
- [zathura](../rocks/zathura.html) is my pdf viewer of choice.
