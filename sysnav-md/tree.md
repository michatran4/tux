# tree
tree lists the contents of directories recursively and in a tree-like format.

## Usage
- tree [options] [directory]

## Options
By default, hidden files aren't printed.

- **-a** Print all files.
- **-d** Print only directories
- **-f** Print the entire file path, including the prefix, for each file
- **-i** Don't print identation lines; can be useful when paired with **-f**
- **-l** Follows through with symbolic links that point to directories (avoids recursion if detected)
- **-L** The max display depth of the directory tree
